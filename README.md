GEvent HTTP Server
======
###### Based on an HTTP server co-authored with [James White](https://github.com/jwhite007) and [Luke Petschauer](https://github.com/lhp81/)

This is a revision of the simple HTTP server to use Python's GEvent.
The server accepts only GET requests to its very limited 'webroot' resource directory.
